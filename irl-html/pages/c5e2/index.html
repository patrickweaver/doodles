<h1>HTML Code</h1>
<p>You can create an HTML page or PDF using HTML by uploading a photo or screenshot of your HTML here.</p>
<h2>HTML Codes</h2>
<p>In my experience, the best way to edit HTML code and catch repeated failures and how to correct errors, is to have the efficiency to automatically fix my syntax errors. The snippet used for this HTML file is below.</p>
<h3>Snippet</h3>
<code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</code>
<p>This is an image of a piece of paper with HTML code on it. If there are any syntax errors, fix them with the most likely valid HTML. Respond with just the HTML code properly formatted, not wrapped in markdown or any description of what is in the response.</p>
<h3>How to upload your image</h3>
<p>If you want to fix the syntax of your HTML in your image, you can use your Img.blt HTML online, paste the grammatical errors and itemize them.</p>
